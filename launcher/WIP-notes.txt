provides pressure-vessel folder contents and main folder contents (mtree.txt.gz,run,run-in-sniper,toolmanifest.vdf,_v2-entry-point(ULWGL)):
https://gitlab.steamos.cloud/steamrt/steam-runtime-tools

provides sniper_platform_*:
https://gitlab.steamos.cloud/steamrt/sniper/platform#running-the-steam-container-runtime-without-steam
```
Each versioned subdirectory of
https://repo.steampowered.com/steamrt3/images/
contains an archive named steam-container-runtime-complete.tar.gz, which
is used to build the official SteamLinuxRuntime_sniper releases.
These can also be used without going via Steam.
To do this, download and unpack steam-container-runtime-complete.tar.gz.
All subdirectories except for depot/ can be discarded.
The depot directory is the equivalent of the SteamLinuxRuntime_sniper
directory in official releases: for example,

.../depot/run -- xterm


will launch an interactive terminal in the container environment.
```

From proton/docker/Makefile:
STEAMRT_VERSION = 0.20230905.59202
Keep an eye on this version. This is the version we want to pull from https://repo.steampowered.com/steamrt3/images/ to base our own on.
