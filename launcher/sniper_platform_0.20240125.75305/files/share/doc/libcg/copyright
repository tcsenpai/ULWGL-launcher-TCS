 License For Customer Use of NVIDIA Software
 .
 IMPORTANT NOTICE -- READ CAREFULLY: This License For Customer Use of
 NVIDIA Software ("LICENSE") is the agreement which governs use of the
 software of NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries ("NVIDIA") downloadable
 herefrom, including computer software and associated printed materials
 ("SOFTWARE"). By downloading, installing, copying, or otherwise using the
 SOFTWARE, you agree to be bound by the terms of this LICENSE.  If you do
 not agree to the terms of this LICENSE, do not download the SOFTWARE.
 .
 RECITALS
 .
 Use of NVIDIA's products requires three elements: the SOFTWARE, the hardware
 on a graphics controller board, and a personal computer. The SOFTWARE is
 protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as
 other intellectual property laws and treaties.  The SOFTWARE is not sold, and
 instead is only licensed for use, strictly in accordance with this document.
 The hardware is protected by various patents, and is sold, but this agreement
 does not cover that sale, since it may not necessarily be sold as a package
 with the SOFTWARE. This agreement sets forth the terms and conditions of the
 SOFTWARE LICENSE only.
 .
 1.  DEFINITIONS
 .
 1.1  Customer.  Customer means the entity or individual that downloads the
      SOFTWARE.

      following non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, non-transferable right
      to use the SOFTWARE, with the following limitations:
 .
 2.1.1  Rights.   Customer may use, reproduce, distribute, publicly display
        and publicly perform the SOFTWARE.
 .
 2.1.2  Limitations.
 .
 No Reverse Engineering.  Customer may not reverse engineer, decompile, or
 disassemble the SOFTWARE, nor attempt in any other manner to obtain the
 source code.

 No Modification.  The SOFTWARE may be redistributed providing that distributed
 Cg compiler and runtime binaries are unmodified, except for decompression and
 compression.

 No Rental.  Customer may not rent or lease the SOFTWARE to someone else.
 .
 No Support.  NVIDIA will not be responsible for providing maintenance and
 support to Customer or any other end users for the Software distributed by
 Customer or others.

 3.  TERMINATION
 .
 This LICENSE will automatically terminate if Customer fails to comply with
 any of the terms and conditions hereof.  In such event, Customer must destroy
 all copies of the SOFTWARE and all of its component parts.
 .
 4.  COPYRIGHT
 .
 All title and copyrights in and to the SOFTWARE (including but not limited to
 all images, photographs, animations, video, audio, music, text, and other
 information incorporated into the SOFTWARE), the accompanying printed
 materials, and any copies of the SOFTWARE, are owned by NVIDIA, or its
 suppliers.  The SOFTWARE is protected by copyright laws and international
 treaty provisions.  Accordingly, Customer is required to treat the SOFTWARE
 like any other copyrighted material.
 .
 Customer  agrees that the Software is proprietary information of NVIDIA and
 that NVIDIA owns all right, title and interest therein. There are no implied
 licenses under this License, and any rights not expressly granted are reserved
 by NVIDIA. The Software is not sold, and instead is only licensed for use,
 strictly in accordance with this License. All copies of the Software shall
 contain NVIDIA's proprietary rights notices as provided therein. Customer
 shall not remove or modify any such proprietary rights notices of NVIDIA. This
 License will automatically terminate if Customer fails to comply with any of
 the terms and conditions hereof. In such event, Customer must cease
 reproducing, distributing, or otherwise using the Software and destroy all
 copies thereof.

 arising hereunder shall be brought in the federal or state courts located in
 Santa Clara County, California, and each party submits to the venue and
 jurisdiction thereof.
 .
 6.  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION ON LIABILITY
 .
 6.1  No Warranties.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY
      APPLICABLE LAW, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND NVIDIA
      AND ITS SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS
      OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED
      WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
      PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
 .
 6.2  No Liability for Consequential Damages.  TO THE MAXIMUM
      EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL
      NVIDIA OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL,
      INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER
      (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF
      BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS
      INFORMATION, OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF

 7.  MISCELLANEOUS
 .
 The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
 Goods is specifically disclaimed.    This agreement is the final, complete
 and exclusive agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter
 hereof, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings and
 agreements relating to such subject matter, whether oral or written.
 Customer agrees that it will not ship, transfer or export the SOFTWARE
 into any country, or use the SOFTWARE in any manner, prohibited by the
 United States Bureau of Export Administration or any export laws,
 restrictions or regulations.
 .
 If any provision of this License is held to be invalid or unenforceable
 for any reason, the remaining provisions will continue in full force
 without being impaired or invalidated in any way.
 .
 No term or provisions hereof shall be deemed waived, and no breach excused,
 unless such waiver or consent is in writing and signed by the party claimed
 to have waived or consented. The waiver by either party of a breach of any
 provision of this License will not operate or be interpreted as a waiver of
 any other or subsequent breach.
 .
 This License may be changed only by mutual agreement in writing of the
 authorized representatives of the parties.
